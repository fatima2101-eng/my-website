      <p class="description">
        <b>Risotto alla Milanese</b> is a luxurious and creamy Italian rice dish, infused with saffron for a stunning golden color 
        and a rich, buttery texture. It’s a dish born in Milan, often served alongside Osso Buco, but also perfect on its own 
        as a comforting, elegant meal. Each spoonful offers warmth, aroma, and depth — a true symbol of northern Italian cuisine.

      <ol>
        <li><b>Warm the broth:</b> In a pot, heat your chicken or vegetable broth and keep it warm over low heat.</li>
        <li><b>Sauté the onion:</b> In a large pan, melt <b>butter</b> and add a drizzle of <b>olive oil</b>. Sauté finely chopped onion until soft and translucent.</li>
        <li><b>Toast the rice:</b> Add the <b>Arborio rice</b> and stir for 2–3 minutes until it becomes slightly translucent at the edges.</li>
        <li><b>Deglaze with wine:</b> Pour in the <b>white wine</b> and stir until it’s mostly absorbed.</li>
        <li><b>Add saffron:</b> Dissolve the <b>saffron threads</b> in a small amount of warm broth, then pour into the rice for its signature golden color.</li>
        <li><b>Add broth gradually:</b> Slowly add a ladle of warm broth at a time, stirring constantly. Let each addition absorb before adding the next.</li>
        <li><b>Finish with butter and cheese:</b> Once creamy and al dente, remove from heat and stir in <b>butter</b> and <b>Parmesan cheese</b> until silky.</li>
        <li><b>Serve immediately:</b> Garnish with extra cheese and a few saffron strands for a touch of elegance.</li>
