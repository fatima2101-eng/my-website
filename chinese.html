      <p class="subtitle">
        Chinese cuisine is one of the world's oldest and most diverse culinary traditions, celebrated for its variety of flavors, techniques, and regional specialties.
        It emphasizes harmony and balance, blending sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami tastes in creative ways.
        From the delicate dim sum of Canton to the bold, spicy dishes of Sichuan, each region has unique ingredients and cooking styles.
        Staples such as rice, noodles, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and fresh vegetables form the foundation of many dishes.
        Traditional techniques include stir-frying, steaming, braising, and roasting, creating meals that are flavorful, healthy, and visually appealing.
        Chinese cuisine also values presentation, with vibrant colors and artful plating that enhances the dining experience.
