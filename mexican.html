      <h1 class="header">A Taste of Mexico</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Mexican cuisine is one of the world’s most vibrant and
         culturally rich food traditions, known for its bold flavors, colorful ingredients, and deep-rooted heritage.
        It highlights balance and authenticity, combining spices, herbs, and fresh produce to create dishes
        that are both comforting and lively.
        From the slow-cooked moles of Oaxaca to the bright, zesty tacos of the streets of Mexico City,
        each region offers its own specialties shaped by local history, geography, and indigenous influences.
        Corn, beans, chilies, tomatoes, and a wide range of meats form the foundation of Mexican meals,
        often paired with handmade tortillas, salsas, and garnishes that enhance every bite.
        Presentation is equally important, with dishes showcasing vibrant reds, greens, and yellows that make 
        the food as visually appealing as it is flavorful.
