      <p class="subtitle">
        Arabic cuisine is rich in tradition, culture, and hospitality, known for its warm spices,
        grilled meats, fresh herbs, and comforting flavors. It reflects centuries of trade,
        travel, and cultural exchange across the Middle East and North Africa.
        From fragrant rice dishes and slow-cooked stews to freshly baked breads and creamy dips,
        Arabic food brings together simple ingredients with bold taste.
        Common elements include dates, olive oil, garlic, chickpeas, lamb, and an
        array of spices such as cumin, cardamom, and saffron.
        Meals are often shared with family and friends, making Arabic cuisine not just about food,
        but also about togetherness, generosity, and celebration.
